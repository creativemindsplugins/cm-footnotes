**The WordPress Footnotes Plugin makes it easy for you to add footnotes to your WordPress pages and posts.**

This plugin lets you quickly add footnotes to any part of your site, giving your readers more context and information without making your main content messy. It’s simple to use, so you can add footnotes in just a few clicks, making your work of creating content easier.

When you use footnotes on your WordPress site, you can give your readers extra resources, references, or explanations, which can help them understand and engage with your content better. Also, the plugin works well with mobile devices, so all your users can access your content.

## Installation

1. Move the plugin folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Activate the plugin using the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. In the admin interface, go to the post or page where you want to add footnotes.
4. Scroll down and find a metabox ‘CM Footnotes - Definitions’.
5. Define a footnote ID. ID values can contain only letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons and periods.
6. Add a footnote definition.
7. Add a shortcode [cm_simple_footnote id="1"] to the needed place in the content to add a footnote link. The "id" of the shortcode must match the id of the definition.
8. Add more footnote definitions if needed.
9. Save the changes.

Note: For the footnote JavaScript and CSS to work correctly, your template needs to have a call to wp_head(). If your theme doesn’t support this, you’ll need to manually add links to these files in your theme (though this isn’t recommended).
